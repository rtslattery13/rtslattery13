Greetings! I’m Ryan Slattery (or as my handle says, @rtslattery13)!


Some of my personal interests include comics and cartoons, collectibles, martial arts and exercise, and cooking.

I am currently studying machine learning at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, NJ. I have expanded my knowledge of various subjects within
the field, such as natural language processing (NLP), data and web mining, and mathematical optimization.
